// Psuedo Coding:

// BattleFrogs with React JSX:
// Two grids, each is a 10x10 2D nested list.
// 5 ships per player:
// carrier 5 (FrogDivision)
// battleship 4 (FrogBrigade)
// cruiser 3 (FrogTroop)
// submarine 3 (FrogPlatoon)
// destroyer 2 (FrogSquad)

// Using React we will Load the App.
// The game will be played entirely with a mouse click system.
// Implement Drag and Drop for Frog placement, and a rotate button.
